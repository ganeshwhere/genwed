# "genwed AI assistant"

**genwed** is an AI-powered assistant designed to help developers troubleshoot and resolve code-related issues directly through a user-friendly web interface. By simply entering error messages or code issues, users receive helpful suggestions to resolve them. This project is currently in its **initial stages**, and there is still much work to be done to expand its capabilities and enhance its accuracy.

Setup and Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or higher
pip (Python package manager)
Installation:

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ganeshwhere/genwed.git
cd genwed
```
Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Download or Train the Model:

If you have a pre-trained model, place it in the genwed folder.
Otherwise, train a custom model using Hugging Face’s transformers library.

Run the Flask server:
```
python genwed_app.py
```

Access the Web Interface:

Open a browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Usage
```
Start the server by running:

python genwed_app.py
```
Visit http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser.

Enter a code issue or error message in the provided text box and click on "Get Suggestion" to receive a potential fix or debugging advice from genwed.

Future Improvements
This project is still in its initial stages, and there are many exciting features and improvements planned:

Enhanced Model Training: Increase model accuracy by training on more code-related data.
Advanced Error Detection: Recognize common programming error patterns for different languages.
Improved User Interface: Create a more dynamic and interactive UI for a better user experience.
Multi-language Support: Extend support to multiple programming languages for bug detection and suggestions.
Integration with IDEs: Allow direct integration with popular IDEs like VSCode.
